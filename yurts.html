          <dt>What is a Yurt?</dt>
          <dd>
            Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off the ground.
            Each yurt is fully enclosed with canvas walls, a wooden floor, and a
            roof dome that can be opened.
          </dd>

          <dt>How are yurts furnished?</dt>
          <dd>
            Each yurt is furnished with a queensize bed with down quit and
            gas-fired stove. Your luxury camping experience includes electricity
            and a sink with hot and cold running water. Shower and restroom
            facilities are located in the lodge.
          </dd>

          <dt>What should I bring?</dt>
          <dd>
            Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for
            changing weather with light layers of clothing. It is also helpful
            to bring a flashlight and a sense of adventure!
